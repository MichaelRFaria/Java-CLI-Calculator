# Command Line Calculator

A simple command-line calculator written in Java.  

This program allows users to input numbers and operations sequentially and evaluate parts or all of the expression interactively.

The calculator specifically stores operands and operators in stacks, which was inspired by my university "Language Processors" [module coursework](https://github.com/MichaelRFaria/Java-Stack-Based-Compiler), where we developed a Java stack based compiler for a small mnemonic based language (similar to assembly language).

## How It Works

- Input a number when prompted.
- Then input an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
- Repeat this process to build up an expression.

## Commands

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` → Adds the operation to the expression.
- `=` → Evaluates the **last two operands and last operator**.
- `==` → Evaluates the **entire expression** from right to left.
- `!` → Exits the program.

## Example

```text
Welcome to the Command Line Calculator
This calculator works by inputting a sequence of numbers and operations
Inputting '+', '-', '*' or '/' will carry out the associated operation
Inputting '!' as an operation will halt the program
Inputting '=' will calculate the result of the last portion of your expression
Inputting '==' will calculate the entire expression

Please input a number: 5
Your expression is: 5 
Please input an operation: +
Please input a number: 3
Your expression is: 5 + 3 
Please input an operation: *
Please input a number: 2
Your expression is: 5 + 3 * 2 
Please input an operation: +
Please input a number: 7
Your expression is: 5 + 3 * 2 + 7 
Please input an operation: =
Your expression is: 5 + 3 * 9 
Please input an operation: ==
Your expression is: 32 
Please input an operation: !

Thank you for using the Command Line Calculator!
Goodbye!
